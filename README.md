<h1>AutoIT Scripts</h1>

<p>A collection of AutoIT scripts I've written and found useful in system administration tasks.</p>

<h2>What's included?</h2>

<h4>lock-screen.au3</h4>

<p>A one-line script that locks the Windows screen. Once compiled as an .exe, this is useful to place in a user's Startup folder to immediately lock the screen after logon. Combine with SysInternals [Autologon](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963905.aspx) for situations that require a console session.</p>
