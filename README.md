<h1>AutoIT Scripts</h1>

<p>A collection of AutoIT scripts I've written and found useful in system administration tasks.</p>

<h3>What's included?</h3>

<h5>lock-screen.au3</h5>

<p>A one-line script that locks the Windows screen. Once compiled as an .exe, this is useful to place in a user's Startup folder to immediately lock the screen after logon. Combine with SysInternals <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963905.aspx">Autologon</a> for situations that require a console session.</p>

<h5>move-mouse.au3</h5>

<p>A short while loop that moves the mouse slightly every 60 seconds.
